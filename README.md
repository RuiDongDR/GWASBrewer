## Simulate Realistic GWAS Summary Statistics for One or Multiple Traits

The `simGWAS` package simulates GWAS summary statistics. The main function in the package is `sim_mv`. For detailed usage of 
this function see the vignette. 

Briefly, `simGWAS` can simulate data with the following features.

- Data an be produced for continuous traits with user supplied linear causal relationships.
- GWAS for multiple traits may have overlapping samples. 
- Data can be generated with or without LD. One realistic LD pattern is supplied as built-in data.

Data generated by `simGWAS` can be used for testing a variety of methods including heritability estimation,
Mendelian randomization, genetic correlation estimation etc.
The package also includes some utilities for LD-pruning and extracting LD matrices for simulated data. 

This package is under active development. Some features that may be added in the future include

- Support for binary traits
- Ability to add confounding effects
- Support for alternative effect size distributions
